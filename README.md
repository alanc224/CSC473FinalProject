## Project Description
##### Problem Statement
Have you ever been bored and wanted to play a stimulating game? For example, you are taking the MTA trains in NYC and you are bored on your phone.
##### Our Solution
Griddle is our user-friendly nonogram puzzle game web application. Based on the hints on the top and left of the grid, players can solve the puzzle shown as an interactive grid. We chose this topic because it seemed like a fun logic puzzle game and an interesting challenge to implement.
##### What are Nonograms?
Nonograms, aka Picross games or Paint-By-Numbers, are picture logic puzzles. They are presented as a grid with the numbers at the edges of the grid. Players color the grid based on the clues to possibly reveal a hidden picture. These puzzles are often black and white and showcase some sort of binary image when completed.


## Demo

## Running
We currently have the frontend of Griddle deployed onto Vercel, however did not deploy the backend, so the login & register functions do not work on Vercel. Both functions work well locally using JWT.
##### Playing Nonogram Game only
You may play on the link above.
##### Running Griddle locally
1) Clone our Github repository.
2) Type "cd nonogram-app" in command prompt
3) Type "npm i" to install necessary dependencies
4) Type "npm run dev" to run our Griddle application locally


## Technologies
- Frontend
  - Framework: Flask
  - Language: Python
  - Deployment: Vercel
- Backend
  - Framework: React
  - Language: Javascript
- Database
  - PostgresSQL (Relational Database)
- Github
- Postman


## Nonogram Game Design
##### Implementation
- Randomly chooses a puzzle (from JSON file) based on the user-selected puzzle size
- Created interactive grid that updates based on user clicks
- Show clues on left and top of the grid
- Game ends when all squares that must be filled in are selected
- It will show an image at the end and a celebratory message describing it
- Extra help (requiring in-game purchases)
  - Hints: reveals random square that is meant to be filled in
  - Checks: checks the current grid to make sure all currently filled in or crossed out squares are correct; if not, it will fill in convert the square into red squares; if everything is correct currently, there will be an alert letting you know there are no mistakes

##### Gamepage
- Our application offer nonogram puzzles of various sizes.
- All of the puzzles are stored in our Nonogram JSON file.
- Users will be able to interactively click on the grid squares
  - Blank -> fill in
  - Filled in -> X
  - X -> blank
- Users can use checks and hints (purchasable items) (in lower right corner of game page) to help them complete these puzzles if need be.

##### Nonogram JSON file
- Created big JSON file to store all the nonogram puzzles (with name of the puzzles, sizes, clues, and answers)
- Formatted into objects of different sizes
  - 5x5, 10x10, 15x15, 20x20
- 2D arrays for the row clues (clues_rows), column clues (clues_cols), and answers (board)


## API Implementation
- We used Stripe API to handle payment & purchases
- Process of user purchasing (hint/check):
  - API generates a unique one-time-use purchase link
  - API creates a success/cancel url
  - If success, user is directed to the success url where their hint/check count is incremented
- This ensures security for userâ€™s credit/debit card information
- To avoid a user spam refreshing the link, we leverage a unique id generated by the API.


## Rubric
- ARCHITECTURE:  MVC (Model, Controller)
  - [model](https://github.com/alanc224/CSC473FinalProject/blob/main/models.py)
  - view -> many sites are interactive with user-friendly UI, such as [gamepage](https://github.com/alanc224/CSC473FinalProject/blob/main/nonogram-app/src/pages/gamepage.jsx)
  - controller -> register & login functions work where users can input info into frontend and it is stored in database by backend
- API:  Project Specific	5%
  - used Stripe API
- BACKEND:  Database (Relational, Non-Relational)	10%;  Python (Language), Flask (Framework), >=10 API Routes	10%  
  - used Flask & Python for backend with 12 API routes in [app.py](https://github.com/alanc224/CSC473FinalProject/blob/main/app.py)
  - used PostgresSQL for relational database 
- FRONTEND:  Framework (Bootstrap, Foundation)	10%;  React, React Router (>=10 Components, >=5 Pages)	10%
  - used React & javascript for frontend with many pages [here](https://github.com/alanc224/CSC473FinalProject/tree/main/nonogram-app/src/pages)
- AUTHENTICATION:  Local Strategy (Session)	10%;  Third Party Strategy (Github, Google, Linkedin)	10%  
  - implemented local strategy (session) authentication (with JWT) [here](https://github.com/alanc224/CSC473FinalProject/blob/main/app.py)
  - attempted third party strategy in zuzu-auth branch (unsuccessful unfortunately)
- DEPLOYMENT:  Cloud Providers (AWS, Azure, GCP), Heroku, Netlify, Vercel, etc	10%
  - deployed frontend using Vercel [here](https://griddle-csc-473-final-project.vercel.app/)
- TESTING:  API; Unit, Integration (>=5 Test)	5%;  Client; Unit, Integration (>=5 Test)	5%
  - API testing using [Postman templates](https://github.com/alanc224/CSC473FinalProject/blob/main/postman-templates/Griddle.postman_collection.json) which can be imported
- MISC:  README (Example)	5%
  - organized readme with info on project & table of contents
- BONUS:  Continuous Deployment	5%;  Continuous Integration	5%;  Local Strategy (JWT; JSON Web Token)	20%
  - implemented continuous deployment using Vercel (as it rebuilds and deploys the newest version based on changes to main branch)
  - implemented local strategy using JSON Web Token [here](https://github.com/alanc224/CSC473FinalProject/blob/main/app.py)
